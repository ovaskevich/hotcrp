reviews.  We hope this feedback will help reviewers improve the quality of
their reviews.  The interface appears above each visible review:</p>

<p><div class='rev_rating'>
  How helpful is this review? &nbsp;<form class><div class=\"inline\">",
            Ht::select("rating", ReviewForm::$rating_types, "n"),

<p>When rating a review, please consider its value for both the program
  committee and the authors.  Helpful reviews are specific, clear, technically
  focused, and, when possible, provide direction for the authors’ future work.
  The rating options are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Average</strong></dt>
<dd>The review has acceptable quality.  This is the default, and should be
  used for most reviews.</dd>
<dt><strong>Very helpful</strong></dt>
<dd>Great review.  Thorough, clear, constructive, and gives
  good ideas for next steps.</dd>
<dt><strong>Too short</strong></dt>
<dd>The review is incomplete or too terse.</dd>
<dt><strong>Too vague</strong></dt>
<dd>The review’s arguments are weak, mushy, or otherwise technically
  unconvincing.</dd>
<dt><strong>Too narrow</strong></dt>
<dd>The review’s perspective seems limited; for instance, it might
  overly privilege the reviewer’s own work.</dd>
<dt><strong>Not constructive</strong></dt>
<dd>The review’s tone is unnecessarily aggressive or gives little useful
  direction.</dd>
<dt><strong>Not correct</strong></dt>
<dd>The review misunderstands the paper.</dd>
</dl>

<p>HotCRP reports the numbers of non-average ratings for each review.
  It does not report who gave the ratings, and it
  never shows rating counts to authors.</p>

To find all reviews with positive ratings, ",
$hth->search_link("search for “re:any&nbsp;rate:+”", "re:any rate:+"), ".
You may also search for reviews with specific ratings; for instance, ",
$hth->search_link("search for “rate:helpful”", "rate:helpful"), ".</p>";
